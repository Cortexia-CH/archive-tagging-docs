## Intro

Cortexia has a tagging application set up where you can find the work queue 
of images to tag, and save your data right away. No hassle, you just need 
a browser and internet.

## Registration

Cortexia will provide you with the credentials to get into the tagging application: 

- url
- login
- initial password (you need to change this on first connection)

## Your Work Queue

In the application you will first find a list of images. 
Please pick one and try to identify waste (or litter) on the images. 
Typical cases would be 

- cigarettes 
- glass bottles 
- plastic bottles
- newspapers
- broken glass
- dog fouling
- leaves

The complete list of litter may change and is available in the application.

## Tagging an image

TODO

## Saving your work

When you move from one image to the next, the work is saved automatically, but you can still go back to that image to make more changes. 

However, once you close your session, all saved images are removed from your work queue and you cannot make any more changes in another session.

## Useful tips

The Zoom function for the images is provided by your operation system. We have quick tips for this on YouTube:
