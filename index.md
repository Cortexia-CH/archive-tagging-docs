## Saving your work

When you move from one image to the next, the work is saved automatically, but you can still go back to that image to make more changes. 

However, once you close your session, all saved images are removed from your work queue and you cannot make any more changes in another session.

## Useful tips

The Zoom function for the images is provided by your operation system. We have quick tips for this on YouTube:
